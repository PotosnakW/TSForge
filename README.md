## Modular Model Build

When adding a model config file in `configs/model/`, select encoder, decoder, and output layer.
Any component can be set to `none` to skip it.
```yaml
d_model: 256
encoder: patchtst      # or rnn, lstm, cnn, none
decoder: none          # only none is currently supported
output_layer: linear_proj  # or none
```

### Supported Tokenization
| `tokenization` | Notes |
|---|---|
| `fixed_patch` | Fixed-length patch tokenization with configurable `patch_len` and `stride` |
 
### Supported Input Layers
| `input_layer` | Key config params | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `linear_proj` | `dropout`, `positional_encoding` | Linear projection with optional positional encodings and dropout |
| `none` | — | No input layer — raw tokens passed directly to encoder |
 
### Supported Encoders
| `model_type` | `encoder` | Key config params |
|---|---|---|
| `transformer` | `patchtst` | `patch_len`, `stride`, `n_heads`, `n_layers`, `hidden_size` |
| `transformer` | `none` | — |
| `rnn` | `rnn` | `n_layers`, `hidden_size`, `dropout` |
| `rnn` | `lstm` | `n_layers`, `hidden_size`, `dropout` |
| `cnn` | `cnn` | `n_layers`, `hidden_size`, `dropout`, `kernel_size`, `dilations` |
| `none` | `none` | — |
 
### Supported Decoders
| `decoder` | Notes |
|---|---|
| `none` | No decoder — encoder output passed directly to output layer |
 
### Supported Output Layers
| `output_layer` | Notes |
|---|---|
| `linear_proj` | Projects last dimension to H × c_out, where c_out is the loss output dimension |
| `none` | No projection — returns encoder/decoder output as-is |

## Dataloaders

### DataLoaderFactory

Central object that owns all dataset construction and dataloader creation.

```python
factory      = DataLoaderFactory(mcfg, dcfg)
train_loader = factory.train_dataloader()
val_loaders  = factory.val_dataloaders()
test_loaders = factory.test_dataloaders()
```

<br>

### FullSeriesDataset vs. PerSeriesDataset

Which class backs a source is driven by its `multivariate` flag in `source/{dataset}` config.

| | `multivariate: true` → `FullSeriesDataset` | `multivariate: false` → `PerSeriesDataset` |
|---|---|---|
| `__len__` | `1` — all channels share one aligned time axis | Number of series in the entry — each independent, own native length |
| Windowing | `fork_sequences` handles all windowing inside `_prepare_batch` | Same, per series |
| Alignment | Channels pre-aligned on shared dates | No cross-series date alignment; left-padded to a common length in the collate_fn |

<br>

### `batch_sampler: HorizonBatchSampler`

Groups datasets by `(horizon, is_multivariate)` so all items in a batch share the same forecast length and data type. When `horizon_override` is set, all datasets collapse into a single group per multivariate flag, allowing free mixing across horizons. Univariate and multivariate datasets are always batched separately and never mixed within a batch.

| `batch_mixing_strategy` | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `concat` | All datasets in a horizon group are pooled into a single index space, weighted by dataset weight. The pool is shuffled and chunked into batches of `batch_size`. All datasets are seen per epoch but batch order is random. |
| `round_robin` | Batches are yielded one horizon group at a time, cycling across groups before repeating. Within each group, datasets are still weighted and pooled. Guarantees each horizon group gets a batch before any group repeats. With a single horizon group, identical to `concat`. |

## Forking-sequences

Forking-sequences architectures generate forecasts for all FCDs simultaneously by reusing the encoder’s computations, whereas window-sampling produces forecasts for each FCD independently. We include an implementation of `forking-sequences` from the methods described in [1, 2]. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/window_sampling.gif" width="400"/>
  <img src="figures/forking_sequences.gif" width="400"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>(a) Window-Sampling &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Forking-Sequences</em>
</p>

The `fcd_samples` parameter is set in the `configs/base/default.yaml` file. It can alternatively be specified in individual model configs in `configs/model/`.

```python
from forgets.dataloaders._forking_sequences import ForkingSequences

# Training — sample FCDs per series
fs_call = ForkingSequences(context_len=512)
out = fs_call(batch, fcd_samples=4, horizon=6)
# Training — Use all FCDs per series
out = fs_call(batch, fcd_samples=-1, horizon=6)

# Val / Test — all valid windows, no sampling
out = fs_call(batch, fcd_samples=-1, horizon=6)
```

<br>

### `fcd_sampler`

Called during training (`fcd_samples != -1`) to pick one `window_start` per series.

```
`homogeneous`
Each series gets the same window_start index.
Any timestep is valid so long as L+H falls within the series length. 
Index sampling **does not** account for left-padding and mid-series gaps. 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
series 1   [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
                        [──── L ────][── H ──]

series 2   [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
                        [──── L ────][── H ──]

series 3   [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
                        [──── L ────][── H ──]
                          ^ ^ ^ ^ L samples padding
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

`heterogeneous`
Each series gets a unique window_start index.
A timestep is only valid so long as L+H falls within the series length and if **all channels** have real data there.
Index sampling **does** account for left-padding and mid-series gaps. 
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
series 1   [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
               [──── L ────][── H ──]

series 2   [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
                         [──── L ────][── H ──]

series 3   [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
                                  [──── L ────][── H ──]

## Training

### Single GPU
```python
from forgets.common.train import train

train(model, mcfg, train_loader, val_loaders, device=torch.device("cuda"))

# Resume from checkpoint
train(model, mcfg, train_loader, val_loaders, resume="checkpoints/final.pt")
```

### Multiple GPUs

**torchrun** (recommended):
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train_script.py
```

**mp.spawn** (programmatic, single-machine):
```python
from forgets.common.train import train_distributed

train_distributed(model, mcfg, factory, use_spawn=True, world_size=4)
```

Sharded datasets are the recommended backend for distributed training — each rank loads a non-overlapping subset of shard files.

| Phase | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Training** | Each rank receives a non-overlapping slice of every horizon group's pool. Padding ensures identical batch counts across ranks — required by DDP's barrier synchronisation. |
| **Validation** | Every rank evaluates the full val set independently (same data, different model weights). Losses are all-reduced and averaged for the global metric. Only rank 0 logs and saves checkpoints. |
| **Test** | Always single GPU. Call `eval_test()` after `dist.destroy_process_group()` has been called. |

### Data Sharding

For datasets too large to fit in RAM, `write_sharded_dataset` partitions data into time-blocked parquet files with configurable shard size.

#### Writing Shards

```python
from forgets.dataloaders.ts_sharding import write_sharded_dataset

write_sharded_dataset(
    df             = full_df,           # long-format DataFrame — must have 'available_mask'
    out_dir        = "data/sharded/simglucose",
    val_size       = 2592,              # matches dcfg entry val_size
    test_size      = 2592,              # matches dcfg entry test_size
    context_length = 512,               # L — baked into shard overlap
    shard_size     = 5_000,             # train timesteps per file
    hist_exog_cols = ["CHO", "insulin"],
)
```

#### Disk Layout

```
out_dir/
    shard_000000.parquet   # t = [0,          shard_size + L)
    shard_000001.parquet   # t = [shard_size,  2·shard_size + L)   ← L-row overlap
    ...
    val.parquet            # t = [train_end - L,  val_end)
    test.parquet           # t = [val_end - L,    T_total)
    static.parquet         # per-channel static features
    metadata.json          # split boundaries, schema, shard index
```

The **L-row right-edge overlap** on each train shard means windows near shard boundaries are self-contained — no cross-file reads needed.

#### Using Shards
First write the shards with `write_sharded_dataset`, then point your dataset config entry at the output directory:
```yaml
- name: "simglucose"
  sharded_dir: "data/sharded/simglucose"
  horizon: 6
  weight: 1.0
```

`path` is not required when `sharded_dir` is set. The factory uses `ShardedTrainDataset`, 
`ShardedValDataset`, and `ShardedTestDataset` directly.

## Metrics

### Training Losses

Select the loss via `mcfg.loss`:

| `mcfg.loss` | Function | Extra config |
|---|---|---|
| `"mae"` | `mae_loss` | — |
| `"mse"` | `mse_loss` | — |
| `"huber"` | `huber_loss` | `delta: 1.0` |
| `"quantile"` | `quantile_loss` | `quantiles: [0.1, 0.5, 0.9]` |

All point-forecast losses share the same signature:
```python
loss_fn(
    preds:   torch.Tensor,         # [B, T, H, C]
    targets: torch.Tensor,         # [B, T, H, C]
    mask:    torch.Tensor | None,  # [B, T, H, C]  1=real, 0=padded/missing
) -> torch.Tensor                  # scalar
```

Masked reduction applied by every loss:
```python
(raw_loss * mask).sum() / mask.sum().clamp(min=1)
```

When `mask is None` a plain `.mean()` is used — equivalent to a mask of all ones.

<br>

### Accuracy Metrics
```python
from forgets.metrics.eval_losses import mae, mse, rmse, mape, smape
```

| Function | Formula |
|---|---|
| `mae`   | `mean( \|y − ŷ\| )` |
| `mse`   | `mean( (y − ŷ)² )` |
| `rmse`  | `sqrt( mse )` |
| `mape`  | `mean( \|y − ŷ\| / \|y\| ) × 100` |
| `smape` | `mean( 2\|y − ŷ\| / (\|y\| + \|ŷ\|) ) × 100` |

Same `(preds, targets, mask)` signature as the training losses above, but on `np.ndarray` and returning a Python `float`.

```python
preds   = results["simglucose"]["preds"].numpy()           # [n_fcds, H, C]
targets = results["simglucose"]["targets"].numpy()         # [n_fcds, H, C]
mask    = results["simglucose"]["outsample_mask"].numpy()  # [n_fcds, H, C]

print("MAE: ", mae(preds, targets, mask))
print("RMSE:", rmse(preds, targets, mask))
```

> **Quantile models** — pass only the median slice to point-forecast metrics:
> ```python
> Q   = len(mcfg.quantiles)
> mid = mcfg.quantiles.index(0.5)
> p_median = preds.reshape(*preds.shape[:-1], -1, Q)[..., mid]
> print("Median MAE:", mae(p_median, targets, mask))
> ```

<br>

### Stability Metrics

Stability metrics operate on the overlapping structure of forking sequences — multiple forecast windows predict the same target date from different horizons, so revisions across consecutive windows can be measured directly. Lower measurements are preferred.

```python
from forgets.metrics.stability_metrics import excess_volatility, forecast_percentage_change
```

#### Excess Volatility (EV)
Measures harmful forecast instability: revisions that incur a quantile-loss cost without a corresponding accuracy improvement.

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/zero-penalty__improving_revision.png" alt="grid" width="235"/>
  <img src="figures/maximum-penalty__degrading_revision.png" alt="second" width="235"/>
  <img src="figures/overshoot-revision_penalty.png" alt="second" width="235"/>
</p>
Fig. Example penalty behavior of the Excess Volatility (EV) metric. EV distinguishes accuracy-improving
revisions from accuracy-degrading ones, assigning no penalty when revisions improve accuracy, while asymmetrically penalizing both deteriorating and overshooting revisions according to their impact on accuracy.

<br>

```python
ev = excess_volatility(
    targets=targets, # [B, T, H, C]
    preds=preds, # [B, T, H, C, Q]
    quantiles=mcfg.quantiles, # [Q]
    mask=mask, # [B, T, H, C]
    scaling=True,
)
```


#### Symmetric Forecast Percentage Change (sFPC)

Measures the relative magnitude of revisions without reference to ground truth. Can be computed on live windows where targets are unavailable.

```python
sfpc = forecast_percentage_change(
    preds=p_median, # [B, T, H, C]
    mask=mask, # [B, T, H, C]
    symmetric=True,
)
```

<br>

## Validation Strategies

Controlled by `mcfg.val_strategy`:

| Strategy | Behaviour | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `exhaustive` | Full pass over all val datasets every check | Final evaluation, small dataset counts |
| `random_datasets` | K random datasets per check (`val_max_datasets`) | Many datasets, preventing val overfitting |
| `stratified` | One random dataset per horizon group | Fast convergence signal across all horizons |

> Test always uses `exhaustive` evaluation regardless of `val_strategy`.

<br>

[↑ Back to top](#top)

<br>

---

<br>


## Inference

```python
results = eval_test(model, factory, device=torch.device("cuda"))
```

Returns a nested dict keyed by dataset name:

```python
{
    "simglucose": {
        "channel_ids":    ["patient_001", "patient_002", ...],
        "preds":          Tensor,   # [n_fcds, H, C]
        "targets":        Tensor,   # [n_fcds, H, C]
        "outsample_mask": Tensor,   # [n_fcds, H, C]   1 = real, 0 = missing
    }
}
```

<br>
 

## Forecast Ensembling
Forking sequences produce multiple overlapping predictions for any given future timestep; ensembling these overlaps can meaningfully reduce variance before computing final metrics.

<p align="center">
  <img src="figures/available_forecast.png" alt="grid" width="250"/>
  <img src="figures/forecast_variance.png" alt="second" width="250"/>
</p>
Fig. a) We adapt forking-sequences during inference to ensemble multiple forecasts of the same future date by
computing a function (e.g., moving average) across predictions generated from previous FCDs. b) Ensembling
improves forecast stability, reducing estimator variance with a linear convergence rate analogous to the weak
law of large numbers.

> See [`notebooks/tsfm_ensembling_demo.ipynb`](notebooks/tsfm_ensembling_demo.ipynb) for a full worked example regarding forecast ensembling with pretrained time series foundation models.

### Methods

| `ensemble_method` | Behaviour | Key kwargs |
|---|---|---|
| `mean`     | Cumulative (or windowed) mean over overlapping windows   | `window_size=None` |
| `median`   | Cumulative (or windowed) median — robust to outlier windows | `window_size=None` |
| `ewm`      | Exponentially weighted mean — recency-biased             | `alpha=0.5`, `window_size=None` |
| `identity` | No aggregation — pass-through                           | — |

`window_size=None` uses all available overlapping windows. Set an integer
to limit aggregation to the N most recent overlaps.
